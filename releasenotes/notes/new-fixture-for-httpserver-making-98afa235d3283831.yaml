    Added a new session scoped fixture ``make_httpserver`` which creates the
    object for the ``httpserver`` fixture. It can be overridden to add further
    customizations and it must yield a ``HTTPServer`` object - see
    ``pytest_plugin.py`` for an implementation. As this fixture is session
    scoped, it will be called only once when the first test using httpserver is
    started. This addition also deprecates the use of ``PluginHTTPServer`` which was
    used in earlier versions as a way to customize server object creation.
    ``PluginHTTPServer`` can still be used but it may be subject to deprecation
    in the future.
