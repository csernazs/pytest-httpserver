    Added a new session scoped fixture ``httpserver_ssl_context`` which provides
    the SSL context for the server. By default it returns ``None``, so SSL is
    not enabled, but can be overridden to return a valid ``ssl.SSLContext``
    object which will be used for SSL connections. See test_ssl.py for example.
