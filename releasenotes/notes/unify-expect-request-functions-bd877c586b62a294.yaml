    Unify request functions of the HTTPServer class to make the API more straightforward to use.
upgrade:
  - |
    The following methods of HTTPServer have been changed in a backward-incompatible way:
      * :py:meth:`pytest_httpserver.HTTPServer.expect_request` becomes a general function accepting handler_type parameter so it can create any kind of request handlers
      * :py:meth:`pytest_httpserver.HTTPServer.expect_oneshot_request` no longer accepts the ordered parameter, and it creates an unordered oneshot request handler
      * :py:meth:`pytest_httpserver.HTTPServer.expect_ordered_request` is a new method creating an ordered request handler
